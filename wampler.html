	This house was originally built in 1857 as a family residence by John & Sarah Mathers. The house, barn, garage, spring house, 
	chicken houses on-top of 4 acres was sold in 1938 for $2,500. The 1917 tornado took the roof off and one of the chimneys. The
	original chimney still sits in the front yard today.<br /><br />
	
	The Wampler House has now been transformed into a large 8 bedroom bed and breakfast.
	This house has been completely restored with amenities such as jacuzzi tubs, gas fireplaces, spa therapy, and walk-out balconies. Many
	use the bed and breakfast for vacation, weekend getaways, honeymoons, anniversaries or business trips.<br /><br />
