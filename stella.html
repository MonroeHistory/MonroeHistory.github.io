Stella's started out as Williams and Wampler General Store in the early 20th century. It was a place of convienence for gasoline and
groceries. A hot bar was located in the back with the menu of sandwiches and coffee.

In 1939, Bloomington was put on the map when a murderer landed a small plane in the pasture next to Willams & Wampler General Store.
Pletch, the pilot, had just dumped a body in Missouri and was flying toward his home in Frankfort when it became dark and had to put
the plane down. The plane was spotted flying near-by, and word quickly got to the nearby telephone operator
Bertha Manner who was able to notify the police. Bob Logston was there at the time at the age
of 6, and still works at Stella's today. Pletch is known for America's first airplane hijacking.<br /><br />
