				<h3> Town Timeline: </h3>
				<p>
	In the 1850s the New Albany and Salem Railroad, later called the Monon ran north and south 
	over the western part of the township. This created opportunity for the development of several stone quarries and stone mills.
	<br /><br />
	
	Clear Creek offered water for the settlers. The town named after this creek. Clear creek now crosses downtown
	Bloomington via underground pipes and flows through Perry Township. Outside city limits,
	it flows through clear creek town. 2/3 of Bloomington's water drains through Clear Creek. 
	Indiana University's Jordan River drains into the creek.<br /><br />
	1853 First train of the Monon reaches Clear creek
	<br /><br />
	Town of Clear Creek developed in the 1890s as workers in stone mills moved into the area. 
	Illinois Central Railroad also laid tracks through town. Passenger trains connecting Louisville 
	and Chicago stopped at Clear Creek Depot twice daily, and freight trains loaded with stone and 
	other goods rumbled through at all hours.
	<br /><br />
	Roads consisted of dusty wagon trails. The community had horses and buggies. No electric lights, not even gas lights.
	Richer people had kerosene lanterns. Occupations were mostly farming, lumbering and masonry.
	Women wove cloth that they made into garments and spun the thread on a wheel.

	1886 Limited scale sugar making, old hands at the business say they always have a big march run. 
	The output was 100 gallons of sweetness and two barrels of good beer. Sugar water beer.
	<br /><br />
	A Cheap Beef wagon was around, making regular calls to your door. 5 cents per pound for second cuts,
	6 cents per pound for excellent roasts, and 7 cents per pound for Porter-house steak. 
	Other places at the time had beef for 15cents per pound. Mr Miller's meat wagon comes once a week
	<br /><br />
	Fishing ponds were popular social gatherings. Bloomington people would sometimes travel down to fish. 
	Amos Wright who ran a sawmill had hosted some of these social gatherings.
	<br /><br />
	In 1917 a tornado tore through north of clear creek town.<br /><br />

</p><h3>Stella's (Willams and Wampler General Store)</h3><p><br />
 4904 S Rogers St<br /><br /><br />

Stella's started out as Williams and Wampler General Store in the early 20th century. It was a place of convenience for gasoline and
groceries. A hot bar was located in the back with the menu of sandwiches and coffee.

In 1939, Bloomington was put on the map when a murderer landed a small plane in the pasture next to Willams & Wampler General Store.
Pletch, the pilot, had just dumped a body in Missouri and was flying toward his home in Frankfort when it became dark and had to put
the plane down. The plane was spotted flying near-by, and word quickly got to the nearby telephone operator
Bertha Manner who was able to notify the police. Bob Logston was there at the time at the age
of 6, and still works at Stella's today. Pletch is known for America's first airplane hijacking.<br /><br />
