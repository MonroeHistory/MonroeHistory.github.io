				<h2>Hello.
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm Kayden. I have a background in various areas of programming and software through my interests and my intern experience
					at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division which I describe later on below. 
					With my major of Informatics, I have great interest in Computing, Engineering, UX/UI Design, and Big Data.</br></br>
					I try to keep up-to-date with innovative companies and technology by following conventions such as the
					Consumer Electronics Show, World Wide Development Center, Google I/O, and Mobile World Congress.
					I also try to participate in reading and listening to a company's earnings conference calls for the companies I believe have
					a strong future. I believe having these hobbies gives me a strong competitive edge in analyzing and adapting with new technology
					advancements. </br></br> 
					My hobbies in general include Traveling & Exploring, Camping, Photography, Photo & Video manipulation, 
					Investing and Reverse Engineering.</br></br>
					
					I am proficient with:</br>
					Microsoft Office, C, Batch, Python, Adobe (Photoshop, Lightroom).</br></br>
					I have experience with:</br> HTML, CSS, MySQL, Microsoft Office(VBScript, Formulas, Macros), Matlab, Java, JavaScript, C++, Adobe (Premiere, After Effects, Animate, XD, Illustrator)
					</br>
